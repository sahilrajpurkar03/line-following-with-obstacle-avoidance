# Line-Following with Obstacle Avoidance

## üîç Description

This project is based on the **Fire Bird V ATMEGA2560 robot**, a microcontroller-based development platform designed at **IIT Bombay** under the **MHRD e-Yantra initiative**. Fire Bird V is the fifth robot in its series and follows an **open-source doctrine** in both hardware and software, ensuring compatibility with environments like **Keil**, **Matlab**, **Scilab**, and **LabVIEW**.

The robot uses:
- **ATmega2560** as the master controller
- **ATmega8** as the slave controller  
to control various sensors and actuators for tasks like **line following** and **obstacle detection**.
