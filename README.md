# Line-Following with Obstacle Avoidance
![Fire Bird Robot Image](docs/FirdBirdBot.png)
## üîç Description

This project is based on the **Fire Bird V ATMEGA2560 robot**, a microcontroller-based development platform designed at **IIT Bombay** under the **MHRD e-Yantra initiative**. Fire Bird V is the fifth robot in its series and follows an **open-source doctrine** in both hardware and software, ensuring compatibility with environments like **Keil**, **Matlab**, **Scilab**, and **LabVIEW**.

The robot uses:
- **ATmega2560** as the master controller
- **ATmega8** as the slave controller  
to control various sensors and actuators for tasks like **line following** and **obstacle detection**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Components Used

- **Microcontrollers**:
  - ATmega2560 (Master)
  - ATmega8 (Slave)
- **Sensors**:
  - 3 IR Proximity Sensors (Port F: 5, 6, 7)
  - 3 White Line Sensors (Port F: 1, 2, 3)
- **Actuators**:
  - Motors (controlled via L293D motor driver)
  - Buzzer
- **Displays**:
  - LCD Display
- **Others**:
  - SHARP IR sensor
  - Ni-MH Battery
  - LEDs

## üß© Interfacing Overview

The project is implemented using **Atmel Studio**, with direct register-level programming of the **ATmega2560** microcontroller.

### üì¶ Register & Port Configuration

| Function                  | Register/Port Used     |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Motor Direction Control  | `DDRA`, `PORTA (0‚Äì3)`  |
| Motor PWM Control        | `PORTL (3, 4)`, `OCR5A`, `OCR5B` |
| Line Sensor Inputs       | `PORTF (1, 2, 3)`       |
| IR Sensor Inputs         | `PORTF (5, 6, 7)`       |
| ADC Configuration        | `ADMUX`, `ADCSRA`, `ADCSRB` |
| Timer for PWM            | `TCCR5A`, `TCCR5B`      |

### üß† Main Code

The core logic for line following and obstacle avoidance is implemented in the following main file:

| File Path                              | Description                                      |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `Fire_bird_project/Fire_bird_project/main.c` | Main program controlling robot behavior ‚Äî including line following, IR sensing, motor control via PWM, and decision-making logic based on sensor data. |

This file:
- Initializes ports, ADC, timers, and LCD.
- Reads input from IR and line sensors.
- Uses PWM to control motor direction and speed.
- Contains the FSM logic (`process()`) to switch between line-following and obstacle-avoidance behavior.

Additional helper functions like `fwd()`, `fwd_left()`, `stop()`, and `ADC_Conversion()` are defined here for modularity and clarity.
